* Today, about 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 4.5 billion people lack access to adequate sanitation (WHO/UNICEF, 2017).
* At present, an estimated 3.6 billion people (nearly half the global population) live in areas that are potentially water-scarce at least one month per year, and this population could increase to some 4.8–5.7 billion by 2050 (WWDR, 2018). 
* Under current trends, demand for water will exceed supply by 40 per cent in 2030 (UNEP, 2015)
* Water-related risks cost more than USD 500 billion per year (Sadoff Claudia et al., 2015)
* The world’s transboundary river basins support the socioeconomic development and wellbeing of humanity and are home to a high proportion of the world’s biodiversity. 151 countries and 2.8 billion people share 286 transboundary river basins (UNEP-DHI and UNEP, 2016).
* According to the 2015 Map of Transboundary Aquifers of the World, worldwide 592 identified transboundary aquifers are transboundary in nature (UN IGRAC).
* Since 1948, history shows only 37 incidents of acute conflict over water, while during the same period, approximately 295 international water agreements were negotiated and signed. (UNECE/UNESCO 2015) 
* Roughly two-thirds of the world’s transboundary rivers do not have a cooperative management framework. (SIWI)
