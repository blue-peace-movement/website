Appealing for cross-border cooperation
--------------------------------------
The SDC, through its active support for the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (the “Water Convention”), has helped forge new paradigms of cross-border cooperation. Its strong advocacy for joint water management results from a detailed analysis of benefits of the countries that lie along the Drina River (Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro), the Cubango-Okavango River Basin (Angola, Botswana and Namibia) and the Sio-Malaba-Malakisi  River Basin (Kenya and Uganda). Their willingness to work together was an economic, social and environmental boon for these countries as well as a factor of peace and security. The Water Convention was originally negotiated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and serves nowadays as international guidelines.

Negotiated water sharing
------------------------
Four countries – Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger – have direct access to Lake Chad. Millions of farmers and breeders depend on its water, yet the lake’s surface area has shrunk by 80 per cent since 1960. The Central African Republic and Libya may be farther away, but they too have an interest in the resources provided by this lake.

The BRIDGE project, run by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and funded by Switzerland, has developed, with the member states of the Lake Chad Basin Commission detailed hydrological maps. They are carefully analysed to identify the effects of climate change. Further down the line, local communities can use them to plan their activities in accordance with the volume of water available to them.

Sustainably managing a scarce resource
--------------------------------------
The Middle East is an arid region where available water resources must be managed in a long-term perspective. In Jordan, the situation has deteriorated following the influx of millions of refugees in the northern part of the country. The rights to the waters of the Yarmouk River, which separates Syria and Jordan, are a long-standing source of contention.

Over the past two years, the SDC overcame difficult circumstances to prepare a rigorous hydrological and political study that now serves as a useful model when it comes to sharing transboundary water resources.

Water diplomacy in Central Asia
-------------------------------
The challenge is formidable: to provide sustainable and safe water access to the 60 million people living in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

As part of the Swiss-led Blue Peace Central Asia initiative, five countries from this region – which is of strategic interest for Switzerland in several respects – are teaming up on this cross-border effort. As such, Switzerland was able to bring together representatives of the five countries in Basel in 2014, for an initial meeting to discuss integrated water resources management.

Since then, high-level “technical dialogues” and study trips have taken place regularly. The last trip brought a delegation of ten officials from the five Central Asian countries to Dakar, to look at how Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Guinea work together at managing the shared Senegal River. The efforts on a political level are accompanied by projects on a technical level, including to provide data and information for evidence-based discussions and ultimately decision-making.

Furthermore, new ways of thinking will require a new generation of public officials and activists. This will be triggered by creating a regional network of young professionals keen on experiencing life in a neighbouring country. It is all about planting the seeds of cross-border solidarity.

Preserving aquifers
-------------------
In the border area between Namibia, South Africa and Botswana, water represents an underground challenge. A large number of people depend on the Stampriet Aquifer for their existence. For now, this aquifer is not in a situation of overuse or pollution. But given local population growth, that could change quickly. Switzerland is funding a UNESCO-run project to generate and collect hydrogeological data in an effort to bolster each country’s responsibility when it comes to planning its water needs and playing its part in sustainably managing the water table.
