<p>Water brings everyone together on our planet called blue.
We value this essential resource so highly because of its scarcity and uneven distribution and quality.</p>
<p>In 2018, as in previous years, water-related crises have been identified among the top five long-term threats to our planet, according to the Global Risks Report published by the World Economic Forum. Is it destined to be a source of endless conflict, as some people fear? Or will it allow dialogue and cooperation – the foundations for peaceful societies – to take root?</p>
<p>The variety of uses, of interests, of approaches and its unequal distribution and scarcity have the potential for competition over water among different users. The competition can take various forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Among individuals, for example water for cattle vs water for irrigation or within the household women having different priorities of water use than men</li>
<li>Among economic sectors, for example the navigation business vs construction of hydropower dams</li>
<li>Among interest groups, for example an association for the preservation of wetlands vs a municipality in favour of draining the area to reduce the risk of malaria, or a factory releasing polluted water vs downstream communities using the river water for domestic uses, or a minorities having a strong spiritual attachment to water vs mining companies using water for extraction</li>
<li>Among generations, for example young decision makers being more sensitive to the principles of integrated water resources management vs an older generation having had an education focusing on the value of infrastructure to regulate water resources</li>
<li>Among levels of authorities, for example a community and the national interest of constructing a dam and reallocating the whole village</li>
<li>Among states, for example between an upstream country producing electricity and retaining the water during summertime to fill up the reservoir vs a downstream country needing water for irrigation mainly during summertime</li>
</ul>
<p>But while these competitions can turn into tension and conflicts over access to water, in many places of the world, it drives to water cooperation.</p>
<p>A cooperative approach is more relevant than ever at a time when population growth and industrial expansion are putting more and more pressure on water supplies, when water is often very poorly recycled, and ecosystems are being disrupted by the impact of climate change. Directly or indirectly, transboundary water cooperation can act as a catalyst for improved international trade, navigation, energy generation, wildlife conservation, economic development, regional integration and improved livelihoods. Furthermore, it is a key enabler of broader peace, security and shared prosperity.</p>
