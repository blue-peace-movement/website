<p>Water has an inestimable value and therefore should not be traded as a commodity as such. What should be traded are the public goods and livelihood assets derived from water to ensure that while everybody has equitable access to these, water will be available in the same quality and quantity both at the entry and exit points of their production cycle. For this we use the term ‘circular economy’. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new way of financing transboundary and multisectoral water cooperation by creating new ways to access financial capital through a Blue Peace approach, which will lead to circular economies and stable societies. Blue Peace is about transforming water from a potential source of crisis into a potential instrument of cooperation and peace through concrete actions, using water as an entry point for transboundary cooperation.</p>
<p>For any sector, industry, household or municipality, long-term access to water in the quantity and quality needed is vital. Thus, water is the perfect entry point for anyone willing to reach the goal of assuring a decent life for all in stable and peaceful societies through increasingly sustainable economies, including in ecological terms. Blue Peace in essence means reaching the above-mentioned goal through the political will to agree on multisectoral and transboundary investments and uses (including preservation) of water through an active negotiation by all interested parties based on the reality of water availability. The negotiating process leads automatically to more effective and financially efficient investment programmes, with reduced tensions or risks of activating conflicts driven by diverging interests, while strengthening accountability lines. Currently, this potential is not understood and therefore not valued by financial investors.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper below is to show that a new generation of financial instruments supporting multisectoral and transboundary investment plans can profit from a Blue Peace approach in terms of reduced risks for financial investors and therefore facilitate easier access to finance for transboundary water organizations and municipalities in both developed and developing countries. This in turn will activate a much needed knowledge exchange among transboundary partners as well as with external supporters, triggering a process geared towards better social inclusion, cooperation enhancement leading to peaceful societies and the establishment of sustainable and circular economies.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
<p>The idea to write this paper was largely triggered by the recommendation on financial innovation for transboundary water cooperation of the Global High-Level Panel for Water and Peace in its report ‘A Matter of Survival’. Particularly discussions among the authors in the context of their work to contribute to the implementation of this recommendation revealed the need for such a paper. We particularly thank the institutions who provided insight and access to different actors that greatly assisted in our discussions, especially the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and the Geneva Water Hub (GWH). We would like to also express our gratitude to other institutions that are working on the implementation of above-mentioned recommendation, such as the Earth Security Partnership and the Strategic Foresight Group, but also the authorities representing the Senegal and the Gambia rivers for the open and constructive discussions we were fortunate to have with them.</p>
